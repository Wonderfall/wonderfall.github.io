      <title>Securing OpenSSH keys with hardware-based authentication (FIDO2)</title>

      <description>Passwordless authentication with OpenSSH keys has been the de facto security standard for years. SSH keys are more robust since they&amp;rsquo;re cryptographically sane by default, and are therefore resilient to most bruteforce atacks. They&amp;rsquo;re also easier to manage while enabling a form of decentralized authentication (it&amp;rsquo;s easy and painless to revoke them). So, what&amp;rsquo;s the next step? And more exactly, why would one need something even better?
Why? The main problem with SSH keys is that they&amp;rsquo;re not magic: they consist of a key pair, of which the private key is stored on your disk.</description>

      <description>Containers aren&amp;rsquo;t that new fancy thing anymore, but they were a big deal. And they still are. They are a concrete solution to the following problem:
- Hey, your software doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;hellip;
- Sorry, it works on my computer! Can&amp;rsquo;t help you.
Whether we like them or not, containers are here to stay. Their expressiveness and semantics allow for an abstraction of the OS dependencies that a software has, the latter being often dynamically linked against certain libraries.</description>

      <description>F-Droid is a popular alternative app repository for Android, especially known for its main repository dedicated to free and open-source software. F-Droid is often recommended among security and privacy enthusiasts, but how does it stack up against Play Store in practice? This write-up will attempt to emphasize major security issues with F-Droid that you should consider.
Before we start, a few things to keep in mind:
The main goal of this write-up was to inform users so they can make responsible choices, not to trash someone else&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>
